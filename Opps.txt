That was a close one, there once was a
time when I had to fill a text document
with nonsense information so I could
push the new server files to the cloud.
Why would someone do this you may aks?
Cause I don't want my grandparent's to see the commit
About me fellating other men on my screen. 
That would just be awkward. Ok? Peace!
